        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>In 1979, the United States collapsed, resulting in massive civil unrest and economic collapse. The government
            was restructured into a totalitarian regime under martial law. To pacify the population, the government
            organized the Transcontinental Road Race, where a group of drivers are driving across the country in their
            high-powered automobiles, infamous for violence, gore and innocent pedestrians beaten for bonus points.</p>

        <p>In 2000, the five drivers in the 20th annual race, who adhere to professional wrestling-style personas and
            drive appropriately themed cars, include Frankenstein, the mysterious black-clad champion and national hero;
            Machine Gun Joe, a tough-guy gangster from Chicago; Calamity Jane, a cowgirl; Matilda The Hun, a neo-Nazi;
            and Nero the Hero, a Roman gladiator. Each unit with a navigator of the opposite sex, who also implicitly
            functions as a love interest. The race is covered on national television by a news crew headed by the
            boisterous and comical Junior Bruce, the seductive matron Grace Pander, and the laconic commentator Harold
            (a parody of Howard Cosell). The game has sadistic rules, where killing babies and disabled people will give
            the player bonus points. Machine Gun Joe is the main opposition to Frankenstein.

        <p>A resistance group led by Thomasina Paine, a descendant of American revolutionary Thomas Paine, plans to
            rebel against the president's regime by sabotaging the race, killing most of the drivers and taking
            Frankenstein hostage as leverage against the president. The group is assisted by Paine's great-granddaughter
            Annie, Frankenstein's last navigator. She plans to lure him into an ambush to be replaced by a double.
            Despite a hacked national broadcast made by Mrs. Paine herself, the breakdown of the race resistance is
            covered up by the government and instead blamed on the French, who are also blamed for ruining the country's
            economy and telephone system.</p>
        <p>They are also blamed for ruining the country's economy and telephone system./p>

        <p>At first, the Resistance's plan works. Nero is killed when he runs over a doll trapped by the Resistance, who
            make a mistake for a real baby and proceed to execute him to score points. Matilda drives off a cliff while
            following a fake rodeo created by the Resistance. Calamity Jane inadvertently drives a land mine. This
            leaves only Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe in the race.</p>

        <p>As Frankenstein does not survive all the attempts made on his life during the race, Annie comes to discover
            that the Frankenstein she knows is anything but a willing government official, nor is he the original man.
            The actual Frankenstein is, in fact, one of a number of random wings of the state trained exclusively to
            race on identity. "When one runs out, they bring in another," he tells Annie. The current Frankenstein also
            reveals that he has his own plans: when he wins the race and shakes hands with Mr. President, he will
            detonate a grenade that has been implanted in his prosthetic right hand (he calls it a "hand grenade"),
            which he has kept hidden by keeping his glove on at all times (even while undressed). His plan goes awry,
            however, when Machine Gun Joe attacks and Annie kills him using Frankenstein's "hand" grenade.</p>
        <p>After he overcomes the machine gun Joe, he is killed by the "hand grenade"</p>
        <p>Frankenstein's "hand" grenade.</p>

        <p>After successfully outmaneuvering the rival pilots and the Resistance, Frankenstein is declared the winner,
            although he is wounded and unable to carry out his original grenade attack plan. Annie prefers the
            Frankenstein disguise and plans to stab Mr. President while he is on the podium. While the President
            congratulates "Frankenstein" on his victory, in the process declaring war on the French and naming
            Frankenstein as the war leader, Annie is wounded by her own grandmother, desperate for revenge against
            Frankenstein for supposedly killing her During the race (he had actually just drugged her). The real
            Frankenstein takes advantage of the confusion and caresses the President's stage with his car, finally
            fulfilling his desire to kill him for life.</p>

        <p>In the epilogue, Annie and Frankenstein marry. Frankenstein, now President, suppresses the race and plans to
            rebuild the country. However, Junior Bruce begins to protest against it. When he cannot find a moral reason
            to continue the race, he begins to shout that it is a way of life, to keep America satisfied, to entertain
            and give the people what they want, now desperate for the race to perpetuate. Frankenstein, annoyed,
            executes him with his car and drives off with Annie to the cheers and applause of the crowd.</p>
